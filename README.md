# ssAC
Super Simple AutoComplete

As the name says, this is a SUPER SIMPLE autocomplete.  Not just in how it functions, but also in how it is written (I ain't no code guru).

It requires jQuery and jQuery UI (although I am going to drop the requirement for UI as soon as I can).

It simply converts a [select][/select] in to an autocomplete list.
If your select starts with a blank [option][/option] you will have the ability to clear the selection.

There are currently TWO options for ssAC:
* startsWith - if true looks at the start of the options for comparing text, if false searches anywhere.
* width - you can override the automatic width selection

YOU can make it look and function how you want to. The code is, after all, "SUPER SIMPLE".
